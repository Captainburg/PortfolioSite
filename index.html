      <h2>
        Who am I?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My name is Cody Clattenburg, I am a BCIT Computer Systems Technology student looking
        for a summer internship in the video games industry.  As a gamer myself, I am very invested in my
        work and care a lot about creating a high quality product that others can enjoy.
        Nothing is better than months of blood, sweat, and tears finally paying off
        as you watch someone play your game for the first time.
      </p>
      <h2>
        More about BCIT
      </h2>
      <p>
        Over the course of my first semester I earned a GPA of 3.81.  I plan to specialize in the digital
        processing option offered in September of 2017, and expect to graduate in May of 2018. My key to success in
        the program so far has been greatly aided by utilizing my fellow students within my set. Without working as a
        team, it would have made the extremely fast moving environment of CST much more difficult. My peers and I have
        worked independently, but done so together, executing on our own tasks and but also knowing when to ask for help.
        Together, we are all part of a 25 person 'set'. There are 5 sets of 25 in total, and I am the set representative
        ours. Part of that includes going to focus groups and to give feedback on the program to the dean, and student
        association. We act as a team to resolve any issues and go through leadership training within the program.
